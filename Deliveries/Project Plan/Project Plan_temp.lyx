\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim of this document is to provide an estimation of the cost that the
 project will take in terms of time, required lines of code and effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process to do this consists in analyzing all the required functionalities
 of the system to be developed and evaluating, one by one, the complexity
 of that operations basing on the number of required data inputs and outputs.
 After doing this a first evaluation of the required number of code lines
 can be made using specific tools, while the estimated time and effort required
 will be provided using the COCOMO solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the cost estimation can be found an identification of the tasks to
 accomplish in order to develop the system, and the project plan that identifies
 the tasks execution order.
 The definition of the tasks allows to do an initial allocation of the human
 resources composing the working team.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally a risk analysis is made in order to identify the principal problems
 that can rise up during the project development: such analysis made a priori
 allows the formulation of a contingency plan that will lead to a risk avoidance
 and will help to solve problems in the eventuality of their appearance.

\begin_layout Section
Function Points
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Function points can be divided into five categories, basing on the type
 of considered data:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
ILF - Internal Logic File: 
\series default
homogeneous set of data used and managed by the application;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
ELF - External Logic File: 
\series default
homogeneous set of data used by the application but generated and maintained
 by other applications;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
External Input:
\series default
 elementary operation to elaborate data coming form the external environment;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
External Output: 
\series default
elementary operation that generates data for the external environment.
 Also includes the elaboration of data from logic files;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
External Inquiry: 
\series default
elementary operation that involves input and output.
 No significant elaboration of data from logic files is needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For every type of function point the estimation will take into acount the
 complexity of the operation, using the following weight table:

\begin_layout Subsection
Function Points Estimation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Internal Logic Files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application includes several internal logic files that are used to store
 information about Customer, Taxi Driver, Generic Call, Ride and Notification.
 Each of these entities has a simple structure as it is composed by a small
 number of fields except for the Generic Call that has a more complex structure
 and needs more operations during the computation (path calculation, search
 for an available taxi driver, ride matching for the shared ones, notification
 to the selected taxi driver and so on).
 Therefore it is adopted a complex weight for Generic Call and a simple
 weight for all other entities.
 The total amount of function points concerning internal logic files is:
 (1x15) + (4x7)=43
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
External Logic Files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application has to use ELFs for execute several operations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
acquisition of the city map and the positions of both Taxi driver and customer.
 These data are obtained using the chosen GPS APIs;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
acquisition of users information through the Google+ service;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
acquisition of users information through the Facebook service;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
interaction with an external banking service.
 Such service sends to the system all the information about the validity
 of the customers payment information and the data related to a specific
 payment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the complexity of these interactions (acquire city map, retrieve
 a position, interface with the banking system) and the structure of the
 received data , it's reasonable to choose a medium weight.
 3x7 + 2x5 =31

Tasks and Schedule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section defines the tasks to be accomplished in order to fulfill the
 goal of the project and the schedule that will define the work that every
 team component will have to perform.
 The chosen model for the project is the 
\emph on
Waterfall Model 
\emph default
which follows a linear execution of the various tasks from the first to
 the last task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The team is composed of three Junior developers, called for simplicity Member
 A, Member B and Member C; due to the limited number of components the decisiona
l issues can be managed by the whole team.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tasks listed below are of two kinds: executable by a single member and
 executable by a group of collaborating members.
 Some of the tasks need to be executed in parallel with other ones, in this
 case the greatest number of members has to be assigned to the most critical
 task.

\begin_layout Section
Risks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Categorizing the risk that could occurr during the project development,
 three categories have been defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Project risks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the main risks that could threat this project is the members management,
 due to the fact that there is not a hierarchy and every decision is made
 after a brainstorming in which all the members are involved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another issue, due to the limited team dimension, is that the project plan
 deadlines could not be respected for several issues: illness or any kind
 of unexpected unavailabilities.
 The way to avoid this is trying to maximize the collaboration of the task
 execution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A third problem could be the withdrawal of one or more members, which could
 be resolved with the assumption of a new member or an extension of the
 deadlines.
 Although it is considered by the COCOMO II tool, it's a risk to be taken
 into account because of the facts that the members continuity is not a
 predictable driver.
 A way to minimize the damn caused if this risk become real is to ask the
 members to notice in time the eventual withdrawal and to have some contact
 eventually available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another potential risk is that, at a certain point of the development course,
 the stakeholders want to add or change some functionalities or requirements;
 this could significantly affect the duration and the effort of the first
 part of the project, depending on the entity of the changes.
 It's possible to try to avoid this risk giving particular importance to
 the first phase of the project, discussing exhaustively all the requirements
 before starting to modelize the application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Technical risks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A potential technical risk to be taken into account is the loss of data
 which the team is working on.
 The most efficient way to avoid or face up this risk is to use Distributed
 Version Control tools like 
\emph on
git
\emph default
 and, eventually, the support of Cloud tools.
 Backups are to be done periodically, i.e.
 at the end of each working day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Business risks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main business risk is that the Government of the large city that committed
 the work changes its mind about the project to be built and stops funding
 the team.
 In order to avoid this unwanted situation, an analysis of the stakeholder's
 reliability should be done by the team.
