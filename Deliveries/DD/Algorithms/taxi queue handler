//taxi queue handler

/*
 *This function handles the taxi queue for a certain zone.
 *It uses some other methods defined below for the basic operations such as refreshing, adding and removing an item from the queue.
 *Some methods are not defined and they refer to the interaction with gps. We don't know weather they exists or not, or exists with different names,
 *but they are surely easily implemented using the gps' API.
